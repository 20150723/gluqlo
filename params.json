{"name":"Gluqlo","tagline":"Fliqlo for Linux","body":"# Gluqlo: Fliqlo for Linux\r\n\r\n![Gluqlo screenshot](http://alexanderk.ru/images/gluqlo.png)\r\n\r\nGluqlo (or Глюкало, if you prefer) is a SDL remake of well-known awesome [Fliqlo screensaver](http://9031.com/goodies/#fliqlo) which is originally avaliable for Windows and OSX platforms only.\r\nGluqlo is inspired by (and to some extent is based on) [noflipqlo](https://github.com/bhm/noflipqlo) aka Now Open Flipqlo 2.0 by [Jacek Kuźniarski](https://github.com/bhm).\r\nCurrently it's very close to original Fliqlo (as I hope); however, flipping animation is not implemented yet :)\r\n\r\n## Requirements\r\n\r\n- SDL 1.2\r\n- SDL_gfx 1.2\r\n- SDL_ttf 2.0\r\n- XScreensaver (optional)\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nFirst, install build-time dependencies (Ubuntu/Debian):\r\n\r\n    $ sudo apt-get install libsdl1.2-dev libsdl-ttf2.0-dev libsdl-gfx1.2-dev libx11-dev ttf-droid\r\n\r\nThen compile and install as usual:\r\n\r\n    $ make && sudo make install\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nIf you want to use Gluqlo as a screensaver, you may need to remove gnome-screensaver (which nowadays just does nothing)\r\nand install XScreensaver (if you're using Ubuntu, see [this page](http://www.howtogeek.com/114027/how-to-add-screensavers-to-ubuntu-12.04/) for detailed instructions;\r\ndon't forget to add gluqlo to your ~/.xscreensaver config file).\r\nOtherwise, you can just run it as is.\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\n1. Fork it!\r\n2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`)\r\n3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some feature'`)\r\n4. Push to the branch (`git push origin my-new-feature`)\r\n5. Create new Pull Request!\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
